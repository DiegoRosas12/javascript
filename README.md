## Install Node.js

Make sure Node.js is installed on your computer.

Install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)

### Install `javascripting` with `npm`

Open your terminal and run this command:

```
npm install -g javascripting
```

The `-g` option installs this module globally so that you can run it as a command in your terminal.

## Run the workshop

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```
javascripting
```

You'll see the menu:

Navigate the menu with the up & down arrow keys. 

Choose a challenge by hitting enter.

### Take a look at this gif that shows the first challenge:

![first challenge](javascripting.gif)

In the gif I'm using the command line editor `nano` ([here are some basic usage tips for nano](https://github.com/sethvincent/dev-envs-book/blob/master/chapters/05-editors.md#nano)).  

You can use any editor you like. 

[atom](http://atom.io) or [brackets](http://brackets.io/) are both good options.
